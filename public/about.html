<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a Full-Stack Developer at the beginning of my journey, currently working on my first project. 
  Even though I'm new to the field, I learn quickly and enjoy every step as I discover more about software development</p>

<p>My background is originally in network engineering and operating systems. I have experience working with Windows Server and Linux,
  and I hold CCNA and MCSA certifications. I also graduated with a Network Engineering degree from the Syrian Private University, 
  which helped me understand how systems work from the inside and how everything connects on a technical level—something
  that strongly supports my work as a developer now.</p>

<p>I enjoy building projects from scratch, connecting the front-end with the back-end, and creating simple,
   clear experiences for users. I focus on clean structure, ease of use, and building things that are practical and scalable.</p>
  <p>
I'm always looking to improve my skills, explore new technologies, and work on projects that help me grow. 
If you have an idea or a project and would like to collaborate,I'm always open to learning more and creating something meaningful together
 </p>
